# eslint-config-paazmaya

> Shared ESLint configuration between my projects since it is possible

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya)
[![devDependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya?type=dev)

## Usage

Install via `npm` command line tool, along with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-paazmaya
```

Note that the minimum ESLint version supported is `5.3.0`, but the latest usually works best.

Change the `.eslintrc.json` to contain the configuration for the shared configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": "paazmaya"
}
```

For further details see [ESLint documentation for Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs).

For example, when [`babel-eslint` parser](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) would be needed:

```json
{
  "extends": "paazmaya",
  "parser": "babel-eslint"
}
```

[Also there is a blog post about "45 Github Issues Dos and Donâ€™ts"](https://davidwalsh.name/45-github-issues-dos-donts).

Linting is done with [ESLint](http://eslint.org) and can be executed with `npm test`.
There should be no errors appearing after any JavaScript file changes.
